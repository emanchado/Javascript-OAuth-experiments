DEPRECATED
==========

This extension is deprecated. It was written for Opera 12, it will not work (I guess?) on Opera >= 15.











Old README contents
===================

This is a barely working Opera extension I'm using to experiment with
OAuth in Javascript. It uses the Opera Link API to show the URLs of
the blocked elements in the current page (if you're wondering if
there's anything missing on the page because it's bloked, you can
click on the pop-up and find out).

Besides, there are Javascript examples to illustrate how to make OAuth
requests with the library I'm using (see oauthtestget.js for GET
requests and oauthtest.js for POST requests).
